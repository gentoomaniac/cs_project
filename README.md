# cs_project
## purpose of this project
The main idea is learning by doing.
To have something to code and learn C# I set myself the goal to implement a commodore 64.
This project is not intended to have a defined finished state (even though a working full emulation certainly would be a finished state). Instead aplying and gaining new knowledge in C# and how this legend of a computer works in detail is the goal.
I'm aware that there is already fully compatible emulaters out there and that C# is not the most efficient choice for this type of task. Again, that is totally fine as coding in C# and learning is my goal here :)

## current state of the emulation
At this point in time I wouldn't call it an emulation yet.
Currently the main part is a piece of code supposedly to represent the MOS6510 with its registers and a subset of the instructions.
The timegiver Y1 and an overall C64 class that is trying to combine the existing components
